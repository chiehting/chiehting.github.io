### Evergreen Note

Question :: 這篇文章的目的及動機?

Answer :: Metadata 在電腦科學裡, 應用的範圍相當廣泛, 例如: 文件、圖檔、影像檔、網站、數據分析、數位資產管理、物聯網等等. 想要理解 Metadata 的概念為何.

### Summary

Metadata (元數據) 為描述檔案的擴展資料, 提供檔案的相關資訊. 以我個人管理筆記的狀況來理解, Metadata 用以記錄筆記檔案的資訊, 但無關筆記的內容, 例如: 建立日期、分類、類型、狀態等等, 都是在描述筆記檔案的資訊.

Metadata 的紀錄可以讓我了解筆記當時的狀態, 類型, 或跟其他筆記的關聯等等.

### Note

Metadata is defined as **the information that describes and explains data**. It provides context with details such as the **source, type, owner, and relationships to other data sets**. So, it can help you understand the relevance of a particular data set and guide you on how to use it. In a nutshell: Metadata is a cornerstone of a modern enterprise data stack.

As Ashish Thusoo and Joydeep Sen Sarma put it in their book titled [Creating a Data-Driven Enterprise with DataOps](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/creating-a-data-driven/9781492049227/ch07.html), metadata is **data about data.**

Here’s how the [University Libraries](https://guides.lib.unc.edu/metadata/definition) from the University of North Carolina lend more context to the definition of metadata:

_Metadata describes a data set (by providing answers to questions such as):_

- _How it was collected?_
- _When was it collected?_
- What assumptions were made in the data collection methodology?
- What is the geographic scope?
- Are there multiple files? If yes, how do they relate to one another?
- What are the definitions of individual variables and, if applicable, what were the possible answers?
- What was the calibration of any equipment used in data collection? And the version of software used for analysis?
